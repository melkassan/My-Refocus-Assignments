Hi, my name is Mel!  I am an aspiring web developer who can cater to your needs in web development using CSS and JavaScript. 
My hobbies are playing basketball because I love the NBA, I enjoy running, and mostly I love watching videos on YouTube. 
My goals for this year is to hopefully land a job in web development and have my first paycheck. 
The reason why I want to become a Web Developer is that aside from it being a high-paying job I also want to witness that it is possible and itâ€™s not too late to get on track and pursue your dream job.
